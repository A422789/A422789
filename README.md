As a passionate Software Engineering student and dedicated React.js Developer, I thrive on transforming complex challenges into elegant, high-performance web applications. My journey isn't just about writing code; it's about architecting solutions. I've built a diverse portfolio of over 10 applications, from enterprise dashboards to full-stack e-commerce platforms, demonstrating a deep commitment to the entire development lifecycle.

My core strength is my versatility. I don't just use libraries; I master them. Whether architecting a pixel-perfect UI from a Figma design using **Tailwind CSS**, or rapidly building a commercial-grade app with **Material-UI (MUI)**, I choose the right tool for the job.

I build full-stack experiences. My projects are a testament to this. I engineered a complete e-commerce ecosystem with a secure **Admin Panel** (featuring CRUD & **Nivo** data charts) and a client-facing **Storefront**. This involved integrating **Firebase** for auth and a real-time Firestore database, handling state for guests (Local Storage) and users, and leveraging the **Cloudinary API** for scalable media management.

My expertise extends to building sophisticated components like drag-and-drop Kanban boards, full-featured calendars, and intelligent data tables. I have a profound understanding of API integration (loading/error states, async operations), as shown in my AI Chatbot project with the **Gemini API**.

A fast learner who quickly masters new technologies, I am now seeking a freelance project or internship where I can apply my broad skill set and contribute to challenging projects.
