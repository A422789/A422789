As a passionate Software Engineering student and dedicated **React.js Developer**, I thrive on transforming complex challenges into elegant, high-performance web applications. My journey isn't just about writing code; it's about architecting solutions. I've built a diverse portfolio of over 10 applications, from enterprise dashboards to full-stack e-commerce platforms, demonstrating a deep commitment to the entire development lifecycle.

### 🚀 My Core Strength & Philosophy

My core strength is my versatility. I don't just use libraries; I master them. Whether architecting a pixel-perfect UI from a Figma design using **Tailwind CSS**, or rapidly building a commercial-grade app with **Material-UI (MUI )**, I choose the right tool for the job.

### 🛠️ I Build Full-Stack Experiences

My projects are a testament to this. I engineered a complete e-commerce ecosystem with a secure **Admin Panel** (featuring CRUD & **Nivo** data charts) and a client-facing **Storefront**. This involved integrating **Firebase** for auth and a real-time Firestore database, handling state for guests (Local Storage) and users, and leveraging the **Cloudinary API** for scalable media management.

My expertise extends to building sophisticated components like drag-and-drop Kanban boards, full-featured calendars, and intelligent data tables. I have a profound understanding of API integration (loading/error states, async operations), as shown in my AI Chatbot project with the **Gemini API**.
